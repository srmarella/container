# - pre-commit is a tool that runs code checks (formatting, linting) before each git commit
# - .pre-commit-config.yaml defines which checks to run (black, isort, etc.)
# - "pre-commit install" sets up git hooks to automatically run these checks

# Smart Snowflake configuration setup with automatic host detection
#
# The goal: You never have to worry about where your config is, and you never leak secrets by accident.
#
# NOTE: The Snowflake VS Code extension always looks for the config at:
#   ~/.snowflake/connections.toml (in your container's home folder)
# This script makes sure that file is always there and correct!

  #    - This is great for team/project configs you want to share.
  #    - We search everywhere, not just the top folder!
  #    - Instead of copying, we make ~/.snowflake a symlink to your project folder.
  #
  #    Why use a symlink?
  #    - Any changes you make to .snowflake in your project are instantly reflected for the extension and CLI.
  #    - No risk of stale or out-of-sync files between project and home.
  #    - You can commit .snowflake to git and share with your team, and everyone gets the same config.
  #    - If you remove or move the project, just remove the symlink and nothing is left behind in your home.
  #
  #    How does it work?
  #    - We remove any existing ~/.snowflake (file, folder, or symlink) to avoid conflicts.
  #    - We create a symlink: ~/.snowflake -> /absolute/path/to/your/project/.snowflake
  #    - The Snowflake extension and CLI see ~/.snowflake/connections.toml as usual, but it's really your project file.
